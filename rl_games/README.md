## Installation

For maximum training performance a preliminary installation of Pytorch 1.9+ with CUDA 11.1+ is highly recommended:

```conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -c nvidia``` or:
```pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html```

Then:

```pip install rl-games```

To run CPU-based environments either Ray or envpool are required ```pip install envpool``` or ```pip install ray```
To run Mujoco, Atari games or Box2d based environments training they need to be additionally installed with ```pip install gym[mujoco]```, ```pip install gym[atari]``` or ```pip install gym[box2d]``` respectively.

To run Atari also ```pip install opencv-python``` is required. In addition, installation of envpool for maximum simulation and training performance of Mujoco and Atari environments is highly recommended: ```pip install envpool```

from rl_games.algos_torch import model_builder
model_builder.register_network('testnet', TestNetBuilder)
```
[simple test environment](rl_games/envs/test/rnn_env.py)

## Release Notes

1.6.1 (Unreleased)
* Fixed Central Value RNN bug which occurs if you train ma multi agent environment.
* Added Deepmind Control PPO benchmark.
* Added a few more experimental ways to train value prediction (OneHot, TwoHot encoding and crossentropy loss instead of L2).
* New methods didn't. It is impossible to turn it on from the yaml files. Once we find an env which trains better it will be added to the config.
* Added shaped reward graph to the tensorboard. 


1.6.0

* Added ONNX export colab example for discrete and continuous action spaces. For continuous case LSTM policy example is provided as well.
* Improved RNNs training in continuous space, added option `zero_rnn_on_done`.
* Added NVIDIA CuLE support: https://github.com/NVlabs/cule
* Added player config everride. Vecenv is used for inference.
* Fixed multi-gpu training with central value.
* Fixed max_frames termination condition, and it's interaction with the linear learning rate: https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games/issues/212
* Fixed "deterministic" misspelling issue.
* Fixed Mujoco and Brax SAC configs.
* Fixed multiagent envs statistics reporting. Fixed Starcraft2 SMAC environments.

1.5.2

* Added observation normalization to the SAC.
* Returned back adaptive KL legacy mode.

1.5.1

* Fixed build package issue.

1.5.0

* Added wandb support.
* Added poetry support.
* Fixed various bugs.
* Fixed cnn input was not divided by 255 in case of the dictionary obs.
* Added more envpool mujoco and atari training examples. Some of the results: 15 min Mujoco humanoid training, 2 min atari pong.
* Added Brax and Mujoco colab training examples.
* Added 'seed' command line parameter. Will override seed in config in case it's > 0.
* Deprecated `horovod` in favor of `torch.distributed` ([#171](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games/pull/171)).

1.4.0

* Added discord channel https://discord.gg/hnYRq7DsQh :)
* Added envpool support with a few atari examples. Works 3-4x time faster than ray.
* Added mujoco results. Much better than openai spinning up ppo results.
* Added tcnn(https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn) support. Reduces 5-10% of training time in the IsaacGym envs. 
* Various fixes and improvements.

1.3.2

* Added 'sigma' command line parameter. Will override sigma for continuous space in case if fixed_sigma is True.

1.3.1

* Fixed SAC not working

1.3.0

* Simplified rnn implementation. Works a little bit slower but much more stable. 
* Now central value can be non-rnn if policy is rnn.
* Removed load_checkpoint from the yaml file. now --checkpoint works for both train and play.

1.2.0

* Added Swish (SILU) and GELU activations, it can improve Isaac Gym results for some of the envs.
* Removed tensorflow and made initial cleanup of the old/unused code.
* Simplified runner.
* Now networks are created in the algos with load_network method.

1.1.4

* Fixed crash in a play (test) mode in player, when simulation and rl_devices are not the same.
* Fixed various multi gpu errors.

1.1.3

* Fixed crash when running single Isaac Gym environment in a play (test) mode.
* Added config parameter ```clip_actions``` for switching off internal action clipping and rescaling

1.1.0

* Added to pypi: ```pip install rl-games```
* Added reporting env (sim) step fps, without policy inference. Improved naming.
* Renames in yaml config for better readability: steps_num to horizon_length amd lr_threshold to kl_threshold



## Troubleshouting

* Some of the supported envs are not installed with setup.py, you need to manually install them
* Starting from rl-games 1.1.0 old yaml configs won't be compatible with the new version: 
    * ```steps_num``` should be changed to ```horizon_length``` amd ```lr_threshold``` to ```kl_threshold```

## Known issues

* Running a single environment with Isaac Gym can cause crash, if it happens switch to at least 2 environments simulated in parallel
